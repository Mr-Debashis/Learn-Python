# Booleans represent one of two values: True or False.

# In programming you often need to know if an expression is True or False.
# You can evaluate any expression in Python, and get one of two answers, True or False.
# When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated and Python returns the Boolean answer:
print(10 > 9)
print(10 == 9)
print(10 < 9)

## Evaluate Values and Variables
# The bool() function allows you to evaluate any value, and give you True or False in return.

# Almost any value is evaluated to True if it has some sort of content.
# Any string is True, except empty strings.
# Any number is True, except 0.
# Any list, tuple, set, and dictionary are True, except empty ones.

print(bool("Hello"))
print(bool(15))
bool("abc")
bool(123)
bool(["apple", "cherry", "banana"])

# In fact, there are not many values that evaluate to False, except empty values, such as (), [], {}, "", the number 0, and the value None. And of course the value False evaluates to False.

bool(False)
bool(None)
bool(0)
